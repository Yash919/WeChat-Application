#### Sharing with Friends
If you wish to engage in conversations with your friends using the chat application, the process is straightforward. First, ensure that the **application is up and running** by executing it on your local machine. Once the application is running, you'll need to share the **IP address** of your machine with your friends. The IP address will be in the format (192.168.xx.xx) **http://192.168.xx.xx:9090**. By sharing this link, your friends will be able to access the chat application from their own devices. This allows them to participate in the conversation and interact with other users, regardless of the system they are using.
